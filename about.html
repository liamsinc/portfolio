                            Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Liam Sinclair and I'm 22 years old. 
                            I am a computer science graduate, having secured a 2:2 overall grade from the 
                            University of East Anglia. I am currently enrolled in the Netmatters 
                            <a class="about-link" href="scs.html">Scion Scheme</a> which builds upon the 
                            web development skills I learnt at university, teaches me about the best industry 
                            standards/practises while also improving my confidence as a developer. This is 
                            complimented by the constructive feedback I receive from a senior developer at Netmatters, 
                            which I firmly believe is the foundation upon which I can improve my coding skills.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="about__item-title">My Education</h2>
                        <p class="about__item-content">
                            I achieved four GCSEs in secondary school: English(B), Maths(5), Science(A), Computer Science (B) 
                        </p>
                        <p class="about__item-content">
                            I then spent two years at a sixth form college and completed an extended BTEC Diploma in IT, 
                            achieving the maximum grade of Triple Distinction *.
                        </p>
                        <p class="about__item-content">
                            After being unconditionally accepted into the University of East Anglia, I spent 3 years 
                            studing computer science. I achieved the grades of second (first class) in my second year and 
                            second (second class) in my third year, ultimately leaving me with an overall grade of second 
                            (second class). I felt I had more potential, so I enrolled in the Netmatters Scion Scheme, to 
                            advance my knowledge and to prepare me for a real working environment. This additional education 
                            and experience has increased my technical competency and my understanding of how IT fits into a 
                            commercial environment.

                        <p class="about__item-content">
                            Despite being a very career-focused individual, I do have external hobbies and interests. 
                            I taught myself how to play the guitar roughly four years ago. I practise daily, and am constantly 
                            seeking to challenge myself through difficult songs. My favourite style of music is that which 
                            contains fingerpicking or arpeggiated chords.
                        </p>
                        <p class="about__item-content">
                            I also have a inextinguishable love for anything related to space and the universe, 
                            often spending my spare time watching space documentaries and keeping up to date with the 
                            latest space related news and events.
