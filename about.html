                            Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Liam Sinclair and I'm 22 years old. 
                            I am a computer science graduate, having secured a 2:2 overall grade from the 
                            University of East Anglia. I am currently enrolled in the Netmatters 
                            <a class="about-link" href="scs.html">Scion Scheme</a> which builds upon the 
                            web development skills I learnt at university, teaches me about the best industry 
                            standards/practises while also improving my confidence as a developer. This is 
                            complimented by the constructive feedback I receive from a senior developer at Netmatters, 
                            which I firmly believe is the foundation upon which I can improve my coding skills.
                        </p>

                    <div class="about__item">
                        <h1 class="about__item-title">My Education</h1>
                        <p class="about__item-content">
                            I achieved four GCSEs in secondary school: English(B), Maths(5), Science(A), Computer Science (B) 
                        </p>
                        <p class="about__item-content">
                            I then spent two years at a sixth form college and completed an extended BTEC Diploma in IT, 
                            achieving the maximum grade of Triple Dintinction *.
                        </p>
                        <p class="about__item-content">
                            After being unconditionally accepted into the University of East Anglia, I spent 3 years 
                            studing computer science. I achieved a 2:1 grade in second year, and a 2:2 grade in third year, 
                            ultimately leaving me with an overall grade of 2:2. I was not happy with this grade considering 
                            the effort I had sustained throughout those three years and the fact that the pandemic significantly 
                            affected teaching quality/standards, and resulted in crucial feedback from module organisers becoming 
                            pretty much non-existent. This is partly the reason I applied for the Netmatters Scion Scheme, as it 
                            provides further training and the course structure helps prepare me for a real working environment. 
                            Additionally, it is something extra to add to my CV.

                        <p class="about__item-content">
                            Despite being a very career-focused individual, I do have external hobbies and interests. 
                            I taught myself how to play the guitar roughly 4 years ago. I practise daily, and am constantly 
                            seeking to challenge myself through difficult songs. My favourite style of music is that which 
                            contains fingerpicking or arpeggiated chords.
                        </p>
                        <p class="about__item-content">
                            I also have a indistinguishable love for anything related to space and the universe, 
                            often spending my spare time watching space documentaries and keeping up to date with the 
                            latest space related news and events. I would have loved to train to become an astronaut, 
                            but unfortunately I was diagnosed with Epilepsy shortly after I turned 10, shattering any 
                            chance of that happening.
